Running exact duplicates and clones of the bots is prohibited.

Reselling and sublicensing of the code is prohibited.

Redistribution of this code as if it was your own is prohibited (plagarism is wrong).

We, the developers, are not responsible for any injury or death caused by the dokis (extremely unlikely), and for the dokis making your server all cutesy, tsundere-like, psychotic, depressing, etc.

Imitating the real dokis is strictly prohibited.

Distrubuting closed-sourced versions of this code is prohibited.

Telling Tsumiki, Cole, or any developer to go f--- themselves or the dokis is also prohibited (although telling Cheezy to go f--- himself is permitted).
